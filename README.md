## Chapters

### **Introduction**  
Overview of the Snakemake workflow and the topGO package for Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. This section introduces how these tools enable automated, rapid, and reproducible bioinformatics workflows.

### **Mapping Gene Symbols**  
Using the `biomaRt` library, annotations are retrieved from the Ensembl database via the `mart.Rmd` script. The key function `getBM()` is employed to map gene symbols and transcript IDs, saving the output as `ens2gene.RDS`.

### **Creating Input Tables**  
This step uses the `format_table.Rmd` script and the `dplyr` library to filter and format differential expression data. Functions like `mutate()` and `filter()` prepare a name vector, which is saved as `present_{logFC}_{adjPval}.RDS`.

### **Performing GO Analysis**  
Run Gene Ontology enrichment analysis using the `ontology.Rmd` script and the `topGO` library. Parameters include `ontology = BP`, `algorithm = classic`, and `statistic = fisher`. Results are visualized in a PDF created with `GenTable()` and `gridExtra`.

### **Constructing the Snakemake Workflow**  
A detailed walkthrough of the `snakefile.py`, which defines the rules for executing each step.  
- **Rule `symbols`**: Executes `mart.Rmd` to map gene symbols.  
- **Rule `table`**: Runs `format_table.Rmd` to prepare input tables.  
- **Rule `ontology`**: Executes `ontology.Rmd` for GO enrichment analysis.

### **Executing the Pipeline**  
Run the pipeline using Snakemake, which automates the workflow by processing all dependencies. This step demonstrates how datasets are processed, and GO enrichment results are generated in a reproducible way.

### **Reviewing Results**  
Visualize the enriched GO terms in a publication-ready PDF. This section explains how to interpret GO terms, statistical significance, and their application in research. Visualization is done using the `gridExtra` library and `grid.table()`.
